    <div id="abs-jmp" class="abstract-text">
      This paper examines how cyclical changes in state appropriations affect public universities’
      decisions and student access. Using institution-level panel data from 2002–2019, I exploit
      cross-state differences in balanced-budget rules and their interaction with local
      unemployment as an instrument for higher-education appropriations. I find that in states
      with stricter balanced-budget requirements, downturns lead to substantially larger cuts in
      state support for public universities. In response to these cuts, institutions primarily adjust
      along the enrollment margin rather than tuition: undergraduate enrollment falls contemporaneously
      and in subsequent years, while tuition responses are limited and imprecisely estimated.
      Universities also shift their program mix toward lower-cost fields. The results highlight how
      fiscal rules can indirectly restrict access to public higher education during economic downturns.

      <a href="#">Evaluating the Impact of an Income Shock on Crime: Evidence from the 2021 Child Tax Credit Expansion</a>
    </h3>
    <p class="paper-meta">with Shenghao Peng</p>

    <a href="#" class="abstract-toggle" onclick="toggleAbstract('abs-ctc'); return false;">▼ Abstract</a>
    <div id="abs-ctc" class="abstract-text">
      This paper investigates how a temporary income shock brought about by the 2021 expansion of
      the U.S. Child Tax Credit (CTC) affects local crime rates. The expanded CTC provided a sizable,
      temporary increase in disposable income for low-income households with children. Using
      administrative arrest data from the 2021–2022 National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS)
      and a difference-in-differences framework, we exploit cross-county variation in exposure to the
      CTC driven by the number of eligible children and household income. We find that each additional
      $1,000 in CTC payments received by eligible families at the county level is associated with 0.15
      more arrests per 1,000 residents. We detect no effect on violent offense arrests and a small
      negative effect on property offense arrests. The results are consistent with previous literature
      in which cash transfers show little or no clear reduction in crime.

    <div id="abs-opioid" class="abstract-text">
      We evaluate a kiosk-based opioid medication return program implemented in a community health
      center serving an economically disadvantaged, largely immigrant population with high opioid
      overdose rates. Using a randomized controlled trial, we compare information-only reminders
      with financial and non-financial incentive arms designed to encourage patients to safely
      dispose of unused prescription opioids. Linking survey data with clinic records, we examine
      take-up of the return program, the volume of opioids removed from circulation, and changes in
      storage and disposal behaviors. The results provide some of the first causal evidence on the
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of health-care–based opioid return programs and inform
      the design of scalable interventions to reduce the supply of unused opioids in the community.
